## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- I learned and practice the grid layout system of the CSS Grid. `grid spacing` gave me a tough positioning time but eventually I got a grip of the positioning.

- I used `margin` and `padding` to center my grid to the page.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me with `grid layout` and `resposiveness`. I really liked this pattern.
